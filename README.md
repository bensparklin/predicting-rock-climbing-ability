# Predicting rock climbing ability
As someone who enjoys rock climbing in my free time, I've wondered which traits make a good rock climber and if these traits could accurately predict rock climbing ability. In this project, I leverage a public rock climbing dataset collected from 8a.nu, a rock climbing community and logbook that rock climbers use to track their ascents (https://www.kaggle.com/dcohen21/8anu-climbing-logbook), to predict rock climbing ability. I clean the data, engineer features, tune hyperparameters, and fit a model to predict the maximum climbing route difficulty a rock climber can complete in this [notebook](predicting_climbing_ability.ipynb).
